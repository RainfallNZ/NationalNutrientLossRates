# NationalNutrientLossRates
R scripts to estimate nitrogen and phosphorous loss rates from land.  
These scripts estimate the magnitude of nitrogen and phosphorous that is lost from the land surface within a catchment above a location.  
This is achieved by adding the loss rates associated with different land uses within a catchment.  
The loss rates are derived from Srinivasan et al. (2021). The land use is derived from a combination of the Land Cover Database Version 5 (Landcare Research NZ Ltd, 2020) and spatial data prepared by Monaghan et al (2021). The catchment is derived from the River Environment Classification V2 (Snelder et al. 2010).   
The purpose of this work is to assist with the understanding of the uncertainty of attenuation estimates, where attenuation is the difference between land surface loss rates and observed river water nutrient concentrations.  
This work is funded by the New Zealand government via the [Our Land and Water National Science Challenge](https://ourlandandwater.nz/).
